MSG-Awareness
=============

Recently we have heard from British student and from a Canadian student that their countries have banned MSG E621. BUT IT"S NOT BANNED! and it should be. http://adfty.info/story.php?title=say-no-to-msg-e621-
MSG, Monosodium Glutamate, (E621) + Rat = FAT RAT!  Hmmm .... What are we doing to the human race? To ourselves? To our loved ones? E621 hides under many names and is part of most “fast foods” so it is near impossible to escape its consumption.
